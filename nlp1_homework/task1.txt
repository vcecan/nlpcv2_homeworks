Each  of the five methods has certain advantages.   The pound  die
     requires no press, but instead, uses a mallet.  It is somewhat lower in
     cost because you do not need to purchase a press, but it is much slower
     to  use and doesn't produce jacketed bullets.   It is ideal for swaging
     large  caliber lead bullets,  and is often selected by  replica  black
     powder  rifle shooters who wish to use an authentic reproduction of the
     earliest form of swaging die (from the 1890's).
          The  reloading  press system is economical since most  handloaders
     already own a suitable reloading press.  It is limited to smaller rifle
     calibers (from .257 to .224) and medium handgun calibers (from .357  to
     .25  ACP) because of the inherent weakness of the slotted  ram.   There
     are certain design restrictions imposed on this system by the press, so
     it  is  not ideal for special work or custom  calibers.   Corbin  makes
     standard  calibers and shapes only,  in this system.   The cost is thus
     kept low for the quality.  Speed is greater than the pound die but less
     than the other, special swaging systems.
          The  Corbin Mity Mite system uses a special horizontal  ram  press
     with more power than any reloading press built.  It is much faster than
     a  reloading press since it ejects the bullet automatically on the back
     stroke.   The dies for this system,  and the matching punches,  do  not
     interchange with the reloading press system.  They are made to fit into
     the RAM of the press,  instead of the press head.  Calibers from .14 to
     .458,  tubing  jackets  with walls of up to  .030-inch  thickness,  and
     weights up to 450 grains, can all be swaged with the Mity Mite.  Custom
     work is done in this system.
          The  Corbin Mega Mite system is based on a massive machined  steel
     press that can handle both reloading and bullet swaging.  It can accept
     ANY  of  the Corbin dies,  including those for the  Hydro-press.   This
     ability  to interchange various kinds of dies can be important to  some
     owners.   However,  there  are limits to any hand-powered  press.   The
     amount of force the Mega Mite produces is awesome,  but still less than
     required for certain large caliber, heavy-jacketed production work.
          The   Corbin  Hydro-press  system  is  the  ultimate   in   bullet
     manufacturing  today.    It  features  automatic  stroke  and  pressure
     control,  electronic  sensors and timing,  programmable stroke control,
     and  many other advanced concepts that place it at the top of the  list
     for custom bullet firms around the world.  Any caliber from 20mm cannon
     to a 10 gauge shotgun slug can be swaged, in virtually unlimited weight
     or  style.   Solid  brass or copper rod can be  formed  instantly  into
     bullets  of  higher  precision than lathe turning.   Lead wire  can  be
     extruded  like  toothpaste.   And the press adapts easily  to  standard
     reloading dies for the convenience of automatic sizing and seating.
          Any  of  the various swaging systems use the principle  that  cold
     metal will flow under sufficient pressure and take on the shape of  the
     vessel holding that pressure.   The swage die is a very strong,  highly
     finished  vessel for containing the pressure.   You swage the bullet in
     all  these systems by driving a punch against the material while it  is
     held within the confines of the die cavity.   Upward expansion from the
     internal  pressure  created is the key factor in forming  the  bullets.
     Reduction in diameter is called "drawing".   Remember,  swaging  always
     expands the bullet or material upward in diameter.
          Drawing dies are used to reduce the diameter of an object, such as
     a  bullet  or a piece of copper tubing or a jacket.   They differ  from
     swaging  dies,  in  that the drawing die has an open top and  only  one
     punch  is used.   The component is pressed through the die and out  the
     top.   In passing through a hardened constriction,  it becomes smaller.
     Drawing has serious restrictions when applied to finished bullets,  and
     can  only  be  used for very limited amounts  of  reduction.   But  for
     reforming  jackets  and  making copper tubing into  jackets,  it  is  a
     valuable tool.
          If  you try to put a piece of lead or a jacket into a die that has
     a smaller diameter of cavity,  the material will be forced down in size
     and  will exert a strong pressure against the sides of the  die.   When
     the pressure is relieved,  by ejecting the component,  the material may
     exert a certain amount of springiness,  and become slightly larger than
     the die cavity.  In making swage dies,  the die-makers have to  contend
     with  the  various  amounts of spring-back in different  hardnesses  of
     jackets,  different thicknesses of jacket wall, and other factors.  The
     die  itself is normally a different diameter from the  actual  finished
     bullet that comes out of it.
          What  this means to you as a potential bullet-maker,  is that  you
     should  NEVER try to force anything into a swage die.   If it won't fit
     easily,  don't push it in.  At best, it will make the wrong diameter of
     bullet.   But  generally,  it  will stick fast in the die  and  require
     special  techniques to remove.   And at worst,  it can generate  enough
     pressure to break the die!
          In  the following chapters,  we'll discuss the various methods  of
     making bullets in more detail, one system at a time.  Bear in mind that
     there are hundreds of possible variations on the techniques,  depending
     on  what you want to make.   It would be impossible to send this manual
     to  you  by mail if every style of bullet were to be described  detail,
     with each step required to make it.   We have to give you the basics of
     making  two  or  three  styles,  and refer you  to  the  more  detailed
     technical books for advanced techniques.
          It  is  far  more important for you to  understand  the  principle
     differences between lead bullet swaging,  semi-wadcutter (and  jacketed
     wadcutter) styles of swaging, and the styles that bring the jacket into
     the nose curve or ogive portion of the bullet.  These three basic kinds
     of  bullets form the basis for everything else.   If you understand how
     to make them,  then variations such as rebated boattails, liquid-filled
     internal cavities,  partitions,  and other advanced designs are  fairly
     simple to pick up.   They aren't different:   they just expand a bit on
     the basic techniques.
